# lis3dh-driver
A Rust driver for the (lis3dh)[https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lis3dh.html] accelerometer using the type-state design pattern.

To learn more about the type-state pattern in embedded applications checkout my blog post here: https://simongorbet.com/projects/lis3dh_driver/

*Note this does not implement all features of the Lis3dh, only the primary functionality. However, it does expose all frequency and reoslution combinations in a safe manner.*
